# DC/OS Install

The installation of DC/OS involves configuring your infrastructure and installing DC/OS bits on top. Some installation methods will configure your infrastructure for you, which results in limited functionality or control. These installation methods should be used for trials and proofs of concept (PoCs) only. 

For fully functional clusters on any infrastructure including on premise, public or private clouds please follow the Production installation instructions.

To test or demo DC/OS on Azure, AWS, GCE, Digital Ocean, or Packet feel free to follow the quick start instructions. These clusters can not be upgraded and functionality may be limited.
