excerpt: Production Installation for fully functional clusters
---

DC/OS is installed in your environment by using a dynamically generated configuration file. This file is generated by using specific parameters that are set during configuration. This installation file contains a Bash install script and a Docker container that is loaded with everything you need to deploy a customized DC/OS build. The Docker container contains all of the bits for DC/OS so it can be used for offline installation.

The DC/OS installation process requires a cluster of nodes to install DC/OS onto and a single node to run the DC/OS installation from. For fully functional clusters on any infrastructure including on premise, public or private clouds, follow the Production installation instructions. The Production installation method was previously called as Custom Installation.
