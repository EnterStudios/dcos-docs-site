The Trial installation method is used to test or demo DC/OS on Azure, AWS, GCE, Digital Ocean, or Packet. These clusters cannot be upgraded and functionality may be limited. The Trial installation method was previously called as Cloud Installation. 

You can use the [Production Installation](/1.11/installing/production/) methods to install a fully functional cluster.
